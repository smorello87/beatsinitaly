Finally—Genova, on a sunny Sunday morning—in an old square wedged in next to the docks on the edge of the port—three or four young types making music—two accordions, one sax and clarinet, and a singer—at a table in the little café garden—drinking and singing. In the South they are sunnier—here the accordion music catches the strange sadness of Genovese faces. ",,Visit to Genova,"Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Writing Across the Landscape.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti,"Contrada da Cossere 20, Brescia, Italy",1958,Italian America,"While traveling from Rome to Naples, Ferlinghetti writes: ""The blood remembers. Or does not remember. America forgets Europe. Ferlinghetti forgets Ferlinghetti. The world turns; and continues turning; and the blood flows, from country to country, continent to continent, through the streets and rivers, to the sea. And the sea carries all away, tides of Napoli flooding into New York harbor, Mannahatta, bristling with spars and masts…""","Ferlinghetti's father, Carlo, was born in Brescia in 1984.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti,"Via Clerici 1, Milano, Italy","December 14, 1982",Setting,"Three bald-headed men at the next table speaking accented English, which is native to none of them. I am trying to figure out their nationalities— Maybe two are Italian and one is from Egypt and doesn’t know the bella lingua. They are discussing deep-sea mining . . . a thousand meters down—nodules! Perhaps I should report it to the Italian CIA—suspicious discussion in English in a restaurant in Milan— It’s the Latin of our time, the language of the Conquerors. . . . This is definitely a peculiar situation— We are alone in the restaurant— I decide at length that they are all Italian, putting me on, for some perverse reason. I decide to pretend I don’t understand the strange language they are talking, maintaining an inscrutable and urban countenance like some debonair expatriate character in Henry James, putting my meat in my mouth with the fork in the left hand after cutting it, in the continental manner, having read an international spy novel in which the American fugitive gives himself away by changing his fork back to his right hand before raising it to his mouth. I am seriously pursuing this line of behavior, as the three men with bald nodules continue their seemingly very serious discussion of the deep sea off the coast of Abyssinia, though at any moment we might all burst out in riotous laughter at the ludicrous absurdity of the whole charade.",The poem was composed during Ferlinghetti's visit to Milan between December 14 and 17 of 1982. ,"""Ristorante Vittoria""","Lawrence Ferlinghetti, ""Ristorante Vittoria"" in Writing Across the Landscape.

leans away from the sun

into darkness

as night fills
