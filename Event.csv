a short man in baggy pants, carrying a radiator of some sort, opened a door and started
hollering at us in the local dialect, “Artisti parassiti! Artisti parassiti!” and
told us to get the hell outta there. We complied, but on the way back to our van a
police car zoomed up and had us against a wall while they checked our papers. It was
obvious that these local cops didn’t know what to do with us, as they telephoned someone
to find out. My cameraman meanwhile was filming the whole scene, with me against the
wall, and he immediately sent off his footage to all the major dailies. Sure enough,

The street scene is still the Italians’ “paradise.” . . . Upstairs, behind closed blinds, on a brass bedstead, an intellectual takes sleeping pills and uses the telephone to call his psychiatrist who also answers in a darkened room in another city in another country where civilization is also continuing to repress Eros, where those who recognize this repression and act upon it are known as anarchists, where even “revolutionaries” say “drugs” and revolution are incompatible . . . the attraction of anarchism today especially among the young (Black Flags in the barricades of Paris & San Francisco) being the attraction of Eros, rather than its political qualities. . . . In “The Mouth of the Lion,” the intellectual turns over in his bed & switches off the light. His sleeping pills are taking effect. He escapes again into his own Eros. The line in my right palm (which a month ago I saw suddenly for the first time, as if it had appeared overnight) just as suddenly seems to be gone. Looked at my palm tonight at dinner in some hotel in Ostia (waiting for a plane) and it just wasn’t there anymore. This hard, sharp line, on the left side of my hand, cut vertically all the way from my heart-line to the base of my life-line. Very strange, how it has disappeared completely. At first I thought it must be the light; I looked more carefully, but it just was not there, the line which a month ago had shocked me by its sudden appearance. Ah, now I do see there is some bare trace of it, as if some threat or great threatened change in my life were now somehow disappearing—not to happen after all. This could very well be. But is this merely a prophecy or a sign of what I should do about my life? The other night, lost as I still am in this Italian Dantesque landscape, I asked whatever supreme power there is in the sky, “for a sign.” “God, give me a sign,” I said, using the word as much as a curseword as for a deity. Maybe this is it. Telling me to “turn back.”",,Visit to Rome,"Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Writing Across the Landscape. Liveright, 2015: 174.",,,41.9046697,12.4808003

Driving to Taormina, the bright landscape a little like the north of Málaga going to Nerja, only cleaner & more beautiful, with Etna’s top on the far horizon, beyond green hills & olive trees, untrimmed plane trees along the narrow road, and on the other side the blue sea close-up, with a red sun just cleared the horizon, and as soon as it gets clear it turns gold-white.

There is an awful lot of bullshit being passed about at this Spoleto Festival. First the gossip had it that Yevtushenko had refused to come because Ezra Pound was coming, and he considers Pound still a Fascist. (But he did come, performed & left immediately—before Pound arrived.) Yevtushenko arrived in a diplomatic limousine from Rome, read with great histrionics (which caused me to dub him “the Discus Thrower of Muscovy”), and then immediately split in his limousine, without making any contact or establishing any communication with poets from other countries. This is pretty bad, considering that the most important thing to be accomplished by any such international meeting is the establishment of personal rapport & communication with other intellectuals normally unreachable behind the obscene boundaries. . . . Then, to continue with the bullshit, it was rumored that Pound would not come because he didn’t want to meet Ferlinghetti who had recently published in City Lights Journal an English translation of an interview Pound had given to the Italian picture magazine Epoca several years ago which Pound considered bad or upsetting. . . .

Allen wept over Keats’s grave and then kissed Shelley’s grave as he knelt to take a clover as a souvenir remembrance. Each day, like the indefatigable tourist that he was, Allen would get up and traipse all over the city taking pictures of Peter and himself in various ruins. On their fourth day in Rome, Allen went to the Vatican museums and became enraged when he discovered the fig leaves that had been added to cover the crotches of the nude Greek and Roman sculptures.

Allen Ginsberg,"Assisi, Italy","August 3, 1957",Event,"That afternoon they took the train as far as Assisi and hiked up the steep hill from the station to the basilica, where they wanted to see the impressive Giotto fresco cycles. With no money left for even the cheapest hotel, they slept on the grass in front of the great Basilica di San Francesco, the burial “place of one of Allen’s visionary heroes, St. Francis. During a sleepless night Allen was frightened by what he imagined were death clouds moving in front of the full moon. Trembling, he and Peter clung to each other in an ancient dark doorway as the nightmare subsided with the dawn. They arose to the bells ringing back and forth between the churches of St. Francis and St. Clare on opposite sides of the small town. While talking to one of the local priests Allen got into an argument with him about the fig leaves that he saw as desecrating the Vatican statues. He was still furious and held all priests accountable for what had been done generations earlier by a prudish pope. In Assisi he and a red-bearded Peter begged for food and queried priests about faith, in some ways acting more like St. Francis than the Franciscans did. Then they hiked a few miles out of town into the hills to the hermitage to which St. Francis had retreated for meditation. After walking back down the mountainside to the basilica they had enough energy left to argue once more with the priests, this time about using their lawn as a camping site, a violation of the rules. The next day, before they left Assisi, a kindly American priest took them around the Porziuncola, the first tiny chapel in which St. Francis had preached. Now the modest chapel was enclosed within the walls of the grandiose Santa Maria degli Angeli Church. They found it ironic that St. Francis, who had given up all his earthly wealth to preach the word of God, had been co-opted and enshrined in such an extravagant way. From Assisi they hitchhiked to Perugia, where they visited the Galleria Nazionale. They saw some good Perugino paintings before sneaking onto a train at dusk as stowaways all the way back to Venice.",,Visit to Assisi,"Bill Morgan, I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg.

 ,"Venice, Italy",November 1967,Event,"Allen went alone to Venice and found a quiet room with a little balcony
in a pension around the corner from Pound's house on the Calle Querini. 
He arrived punctually for lunch as invited and brought along some 
records as a gift. He had the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
Band, Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, and Donovan's Sunshine Superman 
that he wanted to share with Pound. They enjoyed some wine and then
Allen smoked a joint at the table with his coffee, ""without calling attention""
he wrote. What Olga thought is not recorded. Pound said nothing 
throughout the luncheon and Allen looked him straight in the eye and 
asked directly, ""Well, old man, how old are you?"" Finally Pound spoke, 
""82 in several days."" Allen played the records he had brought and then
chanted for another hour before leaving without Ezra's uttering another 
word. Pound was going to be a tough nut to crack, but Allen was 
determined to get some words of wisdom from him, no matter how long it
took. For the next few weeks, Allen hung around Venice, trying to see as
much of Pound as he could. One day they attended a concert of Vivaldi
in a nearby church and a few times they ate lunch out when Olga didn't 
want to cook, Allen discovered that if he asked specific questions about 
references in the Cantos, Pound would offer brief answers. So Allen 
asked about the holy water font Pound mentioned that was supposed to
be to the right of the entrance of St. Mark's, and Pound said that the 
location of the font had been changed since he wrote the poem. Olga told
Allen that no one had invited Pound to read in the United States in years,
and Allen said that he might be preoccupation with stupid and irrelevant 
matters."" The weeks spent with him were boiled down to a few pithy 
phrases. On Pound's eighty-second birthday, October 30, Olga invited 
Allen to come over and he sang the Prajnaparamita Sutra to him by the 
fireplace. Pound sat quietly. He appeared to be sad and ate some birthday
cake and sipped his champagne. The high point of these visits came when,
near the end of Allen's stay, Pound said to him, ""But my worst mistake was
the stupid suburban antisemitic prejudice, all along that spoiled everything""
That was the one sentence that stuck with Allen, for he felt that Pound was
apologizing and by doing so had redeemed himself for all the evil things he
had said about the Jews during his years of Fascist support. Except for the
period in 1954 when he first met Peter in San Francisco, there was no
other time that Allen documented so extensively in his journals than these
few weeks with Pound.",,Ginsberg's meeting with Erza Pound,"Bill Morgan, I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin, 2007: 251-254.",Google Books,"Erza Pound,
