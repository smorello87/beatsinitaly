Bob Dylan,"Rome, Italy",16-19 March 1971,Projected,"Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you’re seein’ double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
She promised that she’d be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin’ time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
[...]
Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
[...]
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent

""Why yass,"" said Dean, and then realized I was serious and looked at me out of the corner of his
eye for the first time, for I'd never committed myself before with regard to his burdensome
existence, and that look was the look of a man weighing his chances at the last moment before the
bet. There were triumph and insolence in his eyes, a devilish look, and he never took his eyes off
mine for a long time. I looked back at him and blushed.
I said, ""What's the matter?"" I felt wretched when I asked it. He made no answer but continued
looking at me with the same wary insolent side-eye. ",,Sal and Dean Dream of Leaving for Italy in On The Road,"Jack Kerouac, On The Road. Viking Press, 1957: 117.",,,42.6384261,12.674297
