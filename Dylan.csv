Bob Dylan,"Piazza Navona, Rome","January or February, 1963",Setting,"This is also where I stay sometime - it snowed last week and my guards as you can see got all covered with snow - bolla regatza everywhere - If I don't open my mouth in this town, everyone thinks I'm Italian (unbelieveable but true I swear).

Bob Dylan,Italy,"September 16, 1974",Projected,"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess

Bob Dylan,"Rome, Italy",16-19 March 1971,Projected,"Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you’re seein’ double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
She promised that she’d be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin’ time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
[...]
Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
[...]
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent
When I paint my masterpiece",,"References to Rome in ""When I Paint My Masterpiece""","Bob Dylan, ""When I Paint My Masterpiece,"" in Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Vol. II. Columbia, 1971.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZQ69w8NmxI,Great,41.8933203,12.4829321
