sono entrato in un labirinto

e una finestra dischiude il cielo

Lei la madre di suo padre
figlia di suo figlio

Io, anch’io sto morendo
in vista di tutto ciò

e bada alla semina della tua terra
possiamo sempre attraversare lo stretto di Messina
Quando un tipo come me cambia terreno
non è senza uno scopo
Sono sempre nei pasticci con gli italiani
le mie parole non significano ciò che sembrano significare
Hai mai fatto la traversata in barca verso l’attica?
Chi è incapace di evitare il pedaggio?
Più vecchio sei più velocemente diventi più vecchio
nel tuo desiderio di servire i tuoi interessi
non distruggerò i tuoi forzieri
ti do tre strofe e un Darico
l’amore
Una volta sotto la zampa della sfinge
l’uomo fece un’apertura
il fragrante soffio d’antico Egitto
uscì fumante
Oh come sognai di fiutare
l’aria vecchia tremila anni!
Ora ai tempi miei un uomo ne ha fatta
un’altra sottoterra
la fine della quale
contiene un’altra nave solare
l’odore è nuovo e madido
ancora in tempo (perché il tempo ospita)
il profumo dell’oggi
raggiungerà il naso del domani
Molte caverne ho conosciuto
una nella quale mia nonna
aveva cura di capre e limoni di Calabria
Cuma, studiai le foglie cadute
il venato messaggio su esse
ed imparai che la profezia era morta
Tusa, dove nessun orso andò mai in letargo,
aveva un pipistrello dentro la sua caverna
che era stata fatta d’un uomo.

Gregory Corso,"Rome, Italy",1980s,Setting,"My beliefs in Roma (""Il mio credo a Roma"") è una poesia di Corso in 12 frasi numerate, nello stile degli elenchi. La prima frase dal sapore buddista dice: ""Io non sono Dio; Dio è me. Io non sono tutto; Dio è tutto. Io non sono te; Dio lo è. Io non sono l' albero; Dio lo è. Dio è me è te l' albero"". L' ultima dice: ""Può darsi che io non sappia tutto quel che c' è da sapere ma so con certezza che non c' è poi così tanto da sapere"". In mezzo, al punto 6 leggiamo: ""Per i sacerdoti di Apis la vacca è sacra. Che cosa è sacro per la vacca?"" Il lungo soggiorno di Corso a Roma ebbe per lui un significato più profondo. Oltre a vantare mitiche radici italiane (""Io sono di una razza ricca del tempo delle terra / Mia nonna era una donna delle caverne / nei monti di Calabria / e sorvegliava le capre, le pecore, e gli alberi di limone / dove Pitagora faceva lezione.. .""), Corso era un poeta erudito sull' arte e la storia. Roma fu per lui, nella sua ricerca di identità e appartenenza, un luogo in cui afferrare, non importa se illusoriamente, radici antiche, e placare un po' la fuga da se stesso e il viaggio all' inferno. Fu un luogo simbolico, ma cosa può anelare un poeta se non a una relazione simbolica, che è la più alta - se si pensa che nell' antichità il symbolon suggellava il patto di ospitalità e protezione che si dava allo straniero? Di sicuro Roma era il luogo in cui volle restare: dove cioè i suoi resti, anche solo in cenere, in simbolo, permanessero a fianco di quelli del suo amato Shelley nel cimitero acattolico detto degli Inglesi, o dei Poeti, al Testaccio.

FRANCIS & THE BIRDS

I praise you your love,
Your benediction of animals and men,
When the night-horn blew,
And the world’s property was disproportioned, Where ere the winged children,
The rabbit,
The afterglow —
Good human tree, birds come to rest;
Not only those which chirp But also those that honk and caw;
I see you with eagle,
Penguin, vulture, seagull;
Nor be it a bird
But an elephant, a herd!
All on your goodly compassionate shoulders.

FRANCIS & THE MIRACLE OF THE WATER

I’m thirsty for something,
something old and hard as rock;
and I don’t doubt my thirst will be satiated —
Ab initio intro, Greek marble breasts did abláctate me; how can I doubt you’d the Bright Plumber’s wand to turn the old hard rock’s faucet on —

SAINT FRANCIS HOLDING THE CHURCH FROM FALLING

The Church is steadfast.
Computers pistons engines hydros dynamos museum it; All is real estate.
What once gave light to dark Now gives dark to light.
The Church should not fall But walk away
And leave behind the glory of its stay —
What is Church?
A mink-necked eccelesiastic with problematical shouts? Trinklet tabernacles with sacred and profane truths? The morning high mass for a dead child in carnations? The evening stillness of an old priest in prayer?
Church is quiet!
Even Lucifer, that once great rebel, is stilled.
St. Sebastian no longer stands full-bodied;
The arrows cling to bone.
I see Christ a skeleton on the cross.
If the Church falls and stone does fall,
If Church-idea is forgotten and ideas are forgotten,
I know within my soul that Christ will always be. Nothing can erase that wonder of man;
Not bomb not anti-Christ nor thought nor me.
Christ is the victory of man
And so made your life, Francis, and most our history —

FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF SAINT FRANCIS

Francis, are you any stranger than Sitting Rull?
You are gone,
And gone the Andrews Sisters too.
What do I really know of you?
That you sent man forth naked And yourself sent;
That you spun your lovers under sun to faint And rise wherever and depart there;
That you made vacant by wish a pig’s foot And so wept the vacancy And so blessed the vacanter —
Francis, I speak to you full:
What good that which is not dead and can do nothing And with cunning complaints to life lives And threatens to die and dies not?
What good the present that sets Like a vaporous tent on the past And sits within a beady prophet of future?
What good that neo-architect
Drenched in the pageant of roseate Rabylon
Scheming crumbling cities to come?
I ask what good anything If the death-law be enforced?
Death is not man’s property
Yet man has raised a vast Hilton there —
What good the holy father holding his right hand over man
When man marries and breeds children
And at his Sunday table upholds the death-law?
What good what is blest by fortune and external harmony When judgment makes up the middle And carrion-things harbor the circle full?
What good what augments water so to give increase to water?
The fish that follows water is to the time of water;
More water makes not for more time —
What good a proper frame of mind on which foundations rest When what is built thereon has no permanence?
What good the magnificent wonders of man If man hurt another man?
What good armies if they are not painted ones?
What good mothers if they give birth In spite of armies and death-law?
What good Hemingway if electric chair?
Francis, I am nearing thirty And have not died as I romantically wished And I am glad that I will be thirty Because I find man indeed life’s victory.
So hail every baby born by every mother For each child is the second coming, yes!
Welcome new age! New space! New whatever!
I feel you near, I hear!
Future Exarchs and Viceroys and Savoies, hail!
Hail magnificent nudity!
I kiss you, little Lichtenstein!
Birth and millennium, Francis, Giotto,
Hail —

FRANCIS CHASING THE DEMONS OUT OF THE CITY

What good you Tritons and Nereids
with your tridents and sea-wreaths when there’s Alcatraz?
What good you Statue of Liberty or Galatea,
the sea is hardly free,
Rikers Island, Ellis Island, Welfare Island; there the demons, those sad mad structures, where wardens, executioners, and guards feast; it’s not Mithras kills their eat, nor the wine they drink be Bacchus kind —",Homage to the great frescoes of the life of St. Francis by the painter Giotto.,"""Saint Francis""","Gregory Corso, ""Saint Francis,"" in Long Live Man.

pulling my hair when I
pulled the leaves off the trees so I'd
know how it feels, we are
involved in it now, revolution, up to our
knees and the tide is rising, I embrace
strangers on the street, filled with their love and
mine, the love you told us had to come or we
die, told them all in that Bronx park, me listening in
spring Bronx dusk, breathing stars, so glorious
to me your white hair, your height your fierce
blue eyes, rare among italians, I stood
a ways off, looking up at you, my grandpa
people listened to, I stand
a ways off listening as I pour out soup
young men with light in their faces
at my table, talking love, talking revolution
which is love, spelled backwards, how
you would love us all, would thunder your anarchist wisdom
at us, would thunder Dante, and Giordano Bruno, orderly men
bent to your ends, well I want you to know
we do it for you, and your ilk, for Carlo Tresca,
for Sacco and Vanzetti, without knowing
it, or thinking about it, as we do it for Aubrey Beardsley
Oscar Wilde (all street lights shall be purple), do it
for Trotsky and Shelley and big/dumb

not even thinking of flying

shielding the widows
the widows with the black long veils
who will outlive them all

The family mourners step out in stiff suits
The widows walk so slowly
up the steps of  the cathedral
fishnet veils drawn down
leaning hard on darkcloth arms

They are merely drawn apart
They are still the matriarchs
outliving everyone

hauled out in the morning sun
that does not mourn for anyone

they are carried out

never stops tolling

for the first time in many years
in these carved black boats

At first I thought it must be the light; I looked more carefully, but it just was not there, the line which a month ago had shocked me by its sudden appearance. Ah, now I do see there is some bare trace of it, as if some threat or great threatened change in my life were now somehow disappearing—not to happen after all. This could very well be. But is this merely a prophecy or a sign of what I should do about my life? The other night, lost as I still am in this Italian Dantesque landscape, I asked whatever supreme power there is in the sky, “for a sign.” “God, give me a sign,” I said, using the word as much as a curseword as for a deity.

There is an awful lot of bullshit being passed about at this Spoleto Festival. First the gossip had it that Yevtushenko had refused to come because Ezra Pound was coming, and he considers Pound still a Fascist. (But he did come, performed & left immediately—before Pound arrived.) Yevtushenko arrived in a diplomatic limousine from Rome, read with great histrionics (which caused me to dub him “the Discus Thrower of Muscovy”), and then immediately split in his limousine, without making any contact or establishing any communication with poets from other countries. This is pretty bad, considering that the most important thing to be accomplished by any such international meeting is the establishment of personal rapport & communication with other intellectuals normally unreachable behind the obscene boundaries. . . . Then, to continue with the bullshit, it was rumored that Pound would not come because he didn’t want to meet Ferlinghetti who had recently published in City Lights Journal an English translation of an interview Pound had given to the Italian picture magazine Epoca several years ago which Pound considered bad or upsetting. . . .

I walked into a loge in the Teatro Melisso, the lovely Renaissance salle where the poetry readings and the chamber concerts were held every day of the Spoleto Festival, and suddenly saw Ezra Pound for the first time, still as a mandarin statue in a box in a balcony at the back of the theatre, one tier up from the stalls. It was a shock, seeing only a striking old man in curious pose, thin and long-haired, aquiline at eighty, head tilted strangely to one side, lost in permanent abstraction. . . .

After three younger poets on stage, he was scheduled to read from his box, and there he sat with an old friend (who held his papers) waiting. He regarded the knuckles of his hand, moving them a very little, expressionless. Only once, when everyone else in the full theater applauded someone on stage, did he rouse himself to clap, without looking up, as if stimulated by sound in a void. . . . After almost an hour, his turn came. Or after a life. . . .

Everyone in the hall rose, turned and looked back and up at Pound in his booth, applauding. The applause was prolonged and Pound tried to rise from his armchair. A microphone was partly in the way. He grasped the arms of the chair with his boney hands and tried to rise. He could not and he tried again and could not. His old friend did not try to help him. Finally she put a poem in his hand, and after at least a minute his voice came out. First the jaw moved and then the voice came out, inaudible. A young Italian pulled up the mike very close to his face and held it there, and the voice came over, frail but stubborn, higher than I had expected, a thin, soft monotone. . . . The hall had gone silent at a stroke. The voice knocked me down, so soft, so thin, so frail, so stubborn still. I put my head on my arms on the velvet sill of the box. I was surprised to see a single tear drop on my knee. The thin, indomitable voice went on. I went blind from the box, through the back door of it, into the empty corridor of the theater where they still sat turned to him, went down and out, into the sunlight, weeping. . . .Up above the town

Some other people reported to me another tableau of Ezra Pound which I had missed at the noon concert. The first event, before the chamber music in the salle itself, was a performance of modern experimental music by an American composer, performing his work on improvised instruments—all percussive—strings & things like Harry Partch’s “cloud chamber bells.” This was set up in the entrance hall to the theatre itself. The hall was full & Pound was ushered to a large chair, center, close to the performer. He said nothing as usual, and sat motionless as usual, looking nowhere. The performance began, the performer bent over his bells & strings & cymbals & timpani & xylophone, barely touching them here & there, his ear close to whatever he touched. One heard nothing at a distance of three yards. Pound, sitting in the pose of that prophetic portrait by Wyndham Lewis (done at least thirty years ago & showing him as he is today—like an old Chinese sage), showed no sign of hearing anything. The performer continued, very silently, intent on his work; not a sound in the air, not a sound in the vacant ear, in the vacant eye of Pound, silence meeting silence.",,"""Pound at Spoleto""","Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Writing Across the Landscape.

Allen Ginsberg,"Assisi, Italy","August 3, 1957",Event,"That afternoon they took the train as far as Assisi and hiked up the steep hill from the station to the basilica, where they wanted to see the impressive Giotto fresco cycles. With no money left for even the cheapest hotel, they slept on the grass in front of the great Basilica di San Francesco, the burial “place of one of Allen’s visionary heroes, St. Francis. During a sleepless night Allen was frightened by what he imagined were death clouds moving in front of the full moon. Trembling, he and Peter clung to each other in an ancient dark doorway as the nightmare subsided with the dawn. They arose to the bells ringing back and forth between the churches of St. Francis and St. Clare on opposite sides of the small town. While talking to one of the local priests Allen got into an argument with him about the fig leaves that he saw as desecrating the Vatican statues. He was still furious and held all priests accountable for what had been done generations earlier by a prudish pope. In Assisi he and a red-bearded Peter begged for food and queried priests about faith, in some ways acting more like St. Francis than the Franciscans did. Then they hiked a few miles out of town into the hills to the hermitage to which St. Francis had retreated for meditation. After walking back down the mountainside to the basilica they had enough energy left to argue once more with the priests, this time about using their lawn as a camping site, a violation of the rules. The next day, before they left Assisi, a kindly American priest took them around the Porziuncola, the first tiny chapel in which St. Francis had preached. Now the modest chapel was enclosed within the walls of the grandiose Santa Maria degli Angeli Church. They found it ironic that St. Francis, who had given up all his earthly wealth to preach the word of God, had been co-opted and enshrined in such an extravagant way. From Assisi they hitchhiked to Perugia, where they visited the Galleria Nazionale. They saw some good Perugino paintings before sneaking onto a train at dusk as stowaways all the way back to Venice.",,Visit to Assisi,"Bill Morgan, I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg.

Allen Ginsberg,"Venice, Italy",November 1967,Event,"Allen went alone to Venice and found a quiet room with a little balcony
in a pension around the corner from Pound's house on the Calle Querini. 
He arrived punctually for lunch as invited and brought along some 
records as a gift. He had the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
Band, Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, and Donovan's Sunshine Superman 
that he wanted to share with Pound. They enjoyed some wine and then
Allen smoked a joint at the table with his coffee, ""without calling attention""
he wrote. What Olga thought is not recorded. Pound said nothing 
throughout the luncheon and Allen looked him straight in the eye and 
asked directly, ""Well, old man, how old are you?"" Finally Pound spoke, 
""82 in several days."" Allen played the records he had brought and then
chanted for another hour before leaving without Ezra's uttering another 
word. Pound was going to be a tough nut to crack, but Allen was 
determined to get some words of wisdom from him, no matter how long it
took. For the next few weeks, Allen hung around Venice, trying to see as
much of Pound as he could. One day they attended a concert of Vivaldi
in a nearby church and a few times they ate lunch out when Olga didn't 
want to cook, Allen discovered that if he asked specific questions about 
references in the Cantos, Pound would offer brief answers. So Allen 
asked about the holy water font Pound mentioned that was supposed to
be to the right of the entrance of St. Mark's, and Pound said that the 
location of the font had been changed since he wrote the poem. Olga told
Allen that no one had invited Pound to read in the United States in years,
and Allen said that he might be preoccupation with stupid and irrelevant 
matters."" The weeks spent with him were boiled down to a few pithy 
phrases. On Pound's eighty-second birthday, October 30, Olga invited 
Allen to come over and he sang the Prajnaparamita Sutra to him by the 
fireplace. Pound sat quietly. He appeared to be sad and ate some birthday
cake and sipped his champagne. The high point of these visits came when,
near the end of Allen's stay, Pound said to him, ""But my worst mistake was
the stupid suburban antisemitic prejudice, all along that spoiled everything""
That was the one sentence that stuck with Allen, for he felt that Pound was
apologizing and by doing so had redeemed himself for all the evil things he
had said about the Jews during his years of Fascist support. Except for the
period in 1954 when he first met Peter in San Francisco, there was no
other time that Allen documented so extensively in his journals than these
few weeks with Pound.",,Ginsberg's meeting with Erza Pound,"Bill Morgan, I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin, 2007: 251-254.",Google Books,"Erza Pound,
