The  museum was filled with pictures of visions and glimpses into mystical events that seemed to speak directly to Allen. It was difficult to decide what masterpiece to concentrate on first; da Vinci, Botticelli, Giotto, and Angelico were all in abundance there.

Allen Ginsberg,"Rome, Italy","August 1, 1957",Event,,"Upon reaching Rome on August 1, Ginsberg and Orlovski set out on foot to explore the expansive city, traversing from the Coliseum to the Pantheon. They started their tour by visiting St. Peter’s Basilica, followed by a leisurely stroll along the Tiber River to the Protestant cemetery, the resting place of poets Shelley and Keats. Ginsberg, moved by the experience, shed tears over Keats’s grave and paid his respects to Shelley's by kissing his tombstone and taking a clover as a keepsake. Each day, Ginsberg, quite the tireless tourist, roamed the city, capturing moments with Orlovski amidst the city's historic ruins. The sight of fig leaves obscuring the nudity of Greek and Roman sculptures at the Vatican museums infuriated Ginsberg, especially after admiring Michelangelo’s unabashedly nude statue of David in Florence. On his last day in Rome, Ginsberg visited Keats's former residence by the Spanish Steps, but lacked the small entrance fee to see the room where Keats succumbed to tuberculosis.",First trip to Rome,"Bill Morgan, I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg.

With their funds depleted, they spent the night on the grass outside the Basilica di San Francesco, a spot sacred to one of Ginsberg's idols, St. Francis. As they spent a restless night under the moon, they experienced a shared, fear-inducing vision. Come morning, they were awakened by the bells of the town's churches. An argument ensued between Ginsberg and a local priest over the fig leaves adorning Vatican statues, an addition Ginsberg saw as a desecration. Despite their struggles, the pair emulated St. Francis, begging for sustenance and engaging in religious discussions with local priests. They even ventured into the hills to visit St. Francis' retreat for meditation. They later clashed with the priests over their unauthorized camping, but also encountered kindness from an American priest who showed them the Porziuncola, the first chapel where St. Francis preached. The irony of the humble chapel's location within the opulent Santa Maria degli Angeli Church wasn't lost on them. Leaving Assisi, they hitchhiked to Perugia, admired Perugino's art in the Galleria Nazionale, before clandestinely boarding a train back to Venice.",Visit to Assisi,"Bill Morgan, I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg.
