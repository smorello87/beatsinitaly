Dont ever go to Beeville boy, or Venice either.” (Beeville a sheriff’d caught him making love to his wife June in the car, parked on the highway, for which he spent two days in jail with a sinister deputy in steel rimmed spectacles.) “Venice—my God, on a clear night you can hear the shrieks of the fairies on St. Marks Plaza a mile away. You can see successful young novelists being rowed away into the night. In the middle of the Canal they suddenly assault the poor Italian Gondoleer. They have palazzos with people straight out of Princeton amortifyin’ chauffeurs.” The funny thing is that when Bull was in Venice he was invited to an elegant party in a Palace, and when he appeared at the door, with his old Harvard friend Irwin Swenson the hostess held out her hand to be kissed—Irwin Swenson said: “You see in these circles you must kiss the hand of the hostess, customarily”—But as everybody stared at the pause in the door Bull yelled out “Aw gee, I’d rather kiss her cont!” And that was the end of that.",The character of Bull Hubbard references in this passage is based on William S.
