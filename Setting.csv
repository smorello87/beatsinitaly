ancora in tempo (perché il tempo ospita)
il profumo dell’oggi
raggiungerà il naso del domani
Molte caverne ho conosciuto
una nella quale mia nonna
aveva cura di capre e limoni di Calabria
Cuma, studiai le foglie cadute

aveva un pipistrello dentro la sua caverna
che era stata fatta d’un uomo.

Gregory Corso,"Rome, Italy",1980s,Setting,"My beliefs in Roma (""Il mio credo a Roma"") è una poesia di Corso in 12 frasi numerate, nello stile degli elenchi. La prima frase dal sapore buddista dice: ""Io non sono Dio; Dio è me. Io non sono tutto; Dio è tutto. Io non sono te; Dio lo è. Io non sono l' albero; Dio lo è. Dio è me è te l' albero"". L' ultima dice: ""Può darsi che io non sappia tutto quel che c' è da sapere ma so con certezza che non c' è poi così tanto da sapere"". In mezzo, al punto 6 leggiamo: ""Per i sacerdoti di Apis la vacca è sacra. Che cosa è sacro per la vacca?"" Il lungo soggiorno di Corso a Roma ebbe per lui un significato più profondo. Oltre a vantare mitiche radici italiane (""Io sono di una razza ricca del tempo delle terra / Mia nonna era una donna delle caverne / nei monti di Calabria / e sorvegliava le capre, le pecore, e gli alberi di limone / dove Pitagora faceva lezione.. .""), Corso era un poeta erudito sull' arte e la storia. Roma fu per lui, nella sua ricerca di identità e appartenenza, un luogo in cui afferrare, non importa se illusoriamente, radici antiche, e placare un po' la fuga da se stesso e il viaggio all' inferno. Fu un luogo simbolico, ma cosa può anelare un poeta se non a una relazione simbolica, che è la più alta - se si pensa che nell' antichità il symbolon suggellava il patto di ospitalità e protezione che si dava allo straniero? Di sicuro Roma era il luogo in cui volle restare: dove cioè i suoi resti, anche solo in cenere, in simbolo, permanessero a fianco di quelli del suo amato Shelley nel cimitero acattolico detto degli Inglesi, o dei Poeti, al Testaccio.

FRANCIS & THE BIRDS

I praise you your love,
Your benediction of animals and men,
When the night-horn blew,
And the world’s property was disproportioned, Where ere the winged children,
The rabbit,
The afterglow —
Good human tree, birds come to rest;
Not only those which chirp But also those that honk and caw;
I see you with eagle,
Penguin, vulture, seagull;
Nor be it a bird
But an elephant, a herd!
All on your goodly compassionate shoulders.

FRANCIS & THE MIRACLE OF THE WATER

I’m thirsty for something,
something old and hard as rock;
and I don’t doubt my thirst will be satiated —
Ab initio intro, Greek marble breasts did abláctate me; how can I doubt you’d the Bright Plumber’s wand to turn the old hard rock’s faucet on —

SAINT FRANCIS HOLDING THE CHURCH FROM FALLING

The Church is steadfast.
Computers pistons engines hydros dynamos museum it; All is real estate.
What once gave light to dark Now gives dark to light.
The Church should not fall But walk away
And leave behind the glory of its stay —
What is Church?
A mink-necked eccelesiastic with problematical shouts? Trinklet tabernacles with sacred and profane truths? The morning high mass for a dead child in carnations? The evening stillness of an old priest in prayer?
Church is quiet!
Even Lucifer, that once great rebel, is stilled.
St. Sebastian no longer stands full-bodied;
The arrows cling to bone.
I see Christ a skeleton on the cross.
If the Church falls and stone does fall,
If Church-idea is forgotten and ideas are forgotten,
I know within my soul that Christ will always be. Nothing can erase that wonder of man;
Not bomb not anti-Christ nor thought nor me.
Christ is the victory of man
And so made your life, Francis, and most our history —

FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF SAINT FRANCIS

Francis, are you any stranger than Sitting Rull?
You are gone,
And gone the Andrews Sisters too.
What do I really know of you?
That you sent man forth naked And yourself sent;
That you spun your lovers under sun to faint And rise wherever and depart there;
That you made vacant by wish a pig’s foot And so wept the vacancy And so blessed the vacanter —
Francis, I speak to you full:
What good that which is not dead and can do nothing And with cunning complaints to life lives And threatens to die and dies not?
What good the present that sets Like a vaporous tent on the past And sits within a beady prophet of future?
What good that neo-architect
Drenched in the pageant of roseate Rabylon
Scheming crumbling cities to come?
I ask what good anything If the death-law be enforced?
Death is not man’s property
Yet man has raised a vast Hilton there —
What good the holy father holding his right hand over man
When man marries and breeds children
And at his Sunday table upholds the death-law?
What good what is blest by fortune and external harmony When judgment makes up the middle And carrion-things harbor the circle full?
What good what augments water so to give increase to water?
The fish that follows water is to the time of water;
More water makes not for more time —
What good a proper frame of mind on which foundations rest When what is built thereon has no permanence?
What good the magnificent wonders of man If man hurt another man?
What good armies if they are not painted ones?
What good mothers if they give birth In spite of armies and death-law?
What good Hemingway if electric chair?
Francis, I am nearing thirty And have not died as I romantically wished And I am glad that I will be thirty Because I find man indeed life’s victory.
So hail every baby born by every mother For each child is the second coming, yes!
Welcome new age! New space! New whatever!
I feel you near, I hear!
Future Exarchs and Viceroys and Savoies, hail!
Hail magnificent nudity!
I kiss you, little Lichtenstein!
Birth and millennium, Francis, Giotto,
Hail —

FRANCIS CHASING THE DEMONS OUT OF THE CITY

What good you Tritons and Nereids
with your tridents and sea-wreaths when there’s Alcatraz?
What good you Statue of Liberty or Galatea,
the sea is hardly free,
Rikers Island, Ellis Island, Welfare Island; there the demons, those sad mad structures, where wardens, executioners, and guards feast; it’s not Mithras kills their eat, nor the wine they drink be Bacchus kind —",Homage to the great frescoes of the life of St. Francis by the painter Giotto.,"""Saint Francis""","Gregory Corso, ""Saint Francis,"" in Long Live Man.

You can see successful young novelists being rowed away into the night. In the middle of the Canal they suddenly assault the poor Italian Gondoleer.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti,"Piazza del Duomo 4, Spoleto, Italy",June 26-July 2 1965,Setting,"POUND AT SPOLETO

I walked into a loge in the Teatro Melisso, the lovely Renaissance salle where the poetry readings and the chamber concerts were held every day of the Spoleto Festival, and suddenly saw Ezra Pound for the first time, still as a mandarin statue in a box in a balcony at the back of the theatre, one tier up from the stalls. It was a shock, seeing only a striking old man in curious pose, thin and long-haired, aquiline at eighty, head tilted strangely to one side, lost in permanent abstraction. . . .

After three younger poets on stage, he was scheduled to read from his box, and there he sat with an old friend (who held his papers) waiting. He regarded the knuckles of his hand, moving them a very little, expressionless. Only once, when everyone else in the full theater applauded someone on stage, did he rouse himself to clap, without looking up, as if stimulated by sound in a void. . . . After almost an hour, his turn came. Or after a life. . . .

Everyone in the hall rose, turned and looked back and up at Pound in his booth, applauding. The applause was prolonged and Pound tried to rise from his armchair. A microphone was partly in the way. He grasped the arms of the chair with his boney hands and tried to rise. He could not and he tried again and could not. His old friend did not try to help him. Finally she put a poem in his hand, and after at least a minute his voice came out. First the jaw moved and then the voice came out, inaudible. A young Italian pulled up the mike very close to his face and held it there, and the voice came over, frail but stubborn, higher than I had expected, a thin, soft monotone. . . . The hall had gone silent at a stroke. The voice knocked me down, so soft, so thin, so frail, so stubborn still. I put my head on my arms on the velvet sill of the box. I was surprised to see a single tear drop on my knee. The thin, indomitable voice went on. I went blind from the box, through the back door of it, into the empty corridor of the theater where they still sat turned to him, went down and out, into the sunlight, weeping. . . .Up above the town

Some other people reported to me another tableau of Ezra Pound which I had missed at the noon concert. The first event, before the chamber music in the salle itself, was a performance of modern experimental music by an American composer, performing his work on improvised instruments—all percussive—strings & things like Harry Partch’s “cloud chamber bells.” This was set up in the entrance hall to the theatre itself. The hall was full & Pound was ushered to a large chair, center, close to the performer. He said nothing as usual, and sat motionless as usual, looking nowhere. The performance began, the performer bent over his bells & strings & cymbals & timpani & xylophone, barely touching them here & there, his ear close to whatever he touched. One heard nothing at a distance of three yards. Pound, sitting in the pose of that prophetic portrait by Wyndham Lewis (done at least thirty years ago & showing him as he is today—like an old Chinese sage), showed no sign of hearing anything. The performer continued, very silently, intent on his work; not a sound in the air, not a sound in the vacant ear, in the vacant eye of Pound, silence meeting silence.",,"""Pound at Spoleto""","Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Writing Across the Landscape.
